# Face Recognition Based Attendance System

This project is a face recognition-based attendance system that uses OpenCV and Python. The system uses a camera to capture images of individuals and then compares them with the images in the database to mark attendance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. ``` git clone https://github.com/AlphaNodesDev/Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System-main.git ```
2. Move The Folder For XAAMM Folder And Run XAMPP 
3. Then Open ```http://localhost/Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System-main/Student-Attendance ```
4. Open Student-Attendance ```cd Student-Attendance ```
4. Install the required packages using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.



## Usage

1. Collect the Faces Dataset by running ``` python get_faces_from_camera_tkinter.py``` .
2. Convert the dataset into ```python features_extraction_to_csv.py```.
3. To take the attendance run ```python attendance_taker.py``` .
4. Check the Database by ```python app.py```.
5. Run ```python get_faces_from_camera_tkinter.py``` 
6. Add multiple Faces and save it 
7. Run ```Python features_extraction_to_csv.py```
8. Run ```attendance_taker.py```
